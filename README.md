Studying Factors that Contributed to Survivability of Titanic Passengers

Objective: Developed a logistic regression model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on variables such as gender, passenger class, and other demographic factors.

Skills: Data Preparation, Logistic Regression, Feature Engineering, Classification Metrics, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, StatsModels, Scikit-learn

Approach:

- Performed comprehensive data cleaning, including converting categorical variables like gender and passenger class into numerical values and removing unnecessary columns.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), visualizing correlations between survival rates and key variables using a heatmap.
- Applied statistical techniques to handle outliers and engineered features to optimize model performance.
- Built and trained a Logistic Regression model to predict survival, interpreting coefficients to assess the impact of various factors (e.g., gender and passenger class) on survival probability.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, and specificity, assessing classification performance with a confusion matrix.

Results: Successfully predicted passenger survival with up to 84% accuracy with insights into how key factors, such as gender and class, significantly affected the odds of survival.
